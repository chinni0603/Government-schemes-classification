# Government-schemes-classification
Led the conception and execution of a significant project aimed at classifying government schemes based on parameters such as age and gender. I developed a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and PHP to provide seamless access to the scheme information.

• Analyzed and categorized various government schemes according to age and gender relevance, contributing to efficient targeting of beneficiaries.
• Ensured user-friendly navigation and accessibility, enhancing the overall user experience and facilitating easy information retrieval.
• Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills by addressing technical challenges during website development, resulting in a robust and functional platform.
